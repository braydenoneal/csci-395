# Prototype 1

Submit initial concepts for your first prototype. These may be sketches, inspiration images, LEGO models -- whatever gets the idea across.

More visual aspects where incorporated than there typically should be for a low fidelity prototype because the look and feel are one of the most important aspects of the device.
