# Initial Pitch

Prepare an initial pitch for your product idea. At this stage it will only be a concept. You will develop and refine the concept in the coming weeks. Try to answer -- or at least consider -- the following questions:

Project description:
> A small and portable music player that plays physical analog audio. 

1. Who is this for and why would they want it (i.e. what will it do for them).
> People who enjoy vinyl records, CDs, cassettes, etc. because of the physical connection and ownership of physical media, that also want a more portable version of physical audio. It would allow them to take the analog audio experience with them in the car, when they travel, and in their pocket.
2. Who are the primary customers? Users, if different?
> The customers and users would likely be the same, people who already enjoy physical audio, but want a more portable version of that. It could also appeal to people who want a more budget-friendly analog audio experience.
3. At this point, what do you consider the most important usability goals for your product? (You may want to review usability goals from CSCI 322)
> Portable, easy to use, simple, quick to use (switching out albums), non-distracting (easy to use without looking at it), versatile (home use, car, pocket, etc.)
4. Are there specific design risks you need to be sure to address?
> The ability to fit analog audio on such a small form factor, the adoption of the media by music publishers, keeping the music player fun and novel, but still easy and efficient to use (having to switch albums out every few minutes could become annoying).
5. Are there specific interaction types, paradigms, frameworks, etc., that you believe will be helpful or necessary?
> Prototyping and user testing will be important for getting an idea of the experience with the real product and refining the design. User personas will also help keep in mind the target users when creating the design.
6. Which -- if any -- cognitive aspects of interaction will be important to your product?
> User engagement to ensure the music player is fun to use, user perception of the experience of using the device (does the design convey its purpose and functionality in a straight-forward way?), the user's past-experiences will inform how to make the design more intuitive.
