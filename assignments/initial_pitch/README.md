# Initial Pitch

Prepare an initial pitch for your product idea. At this stage it will only be a concept. You will develop and refine the concept in the coming weeks. Try to answer -- or at least consider -- the following questions:

1. Who is this for and why would they want it (i.e. what will it do for them).
2. Who are the primary customers? Users, if different?
3. At this point, what do you consider the most important usability goals for your product? (You may want to review usability goals from CSCI 322)
4. Are there specific design risks you need to be sure to address?
5. Are there specific interaction types, paradigms, frameworks, etc., that you believe will be helpful or necessary?
6. Which -- if any -- cognitive aspects of interaction will be important to your product? Submit a PDF or short video to Canvas and be prepared to present your idea to the class.
